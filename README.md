# PROJECT---4.1-and-4.2-JKUAT
This repository contains my final year project as a BSc Data Science and Analytics student at JKUAT. The project focuses on developing a personal recommender system for financial education content to bridge gender gaps in financial literacy. It includes data analysis, machine learning models, and insights derived from real-world datasets.
